Hello there,

This is an ongoing Skill System I'm working on.
It contains a Skill Tree and a Mastery system for leveling.

The system uses an Event-Driven Architecture Design with isolated and independent microservices.
There's also a Queue System, since parallel signals can cause weird sync issues â€” using a queue was the more advanced and stable way to solve that (and more).

On the client side, we've got a nice reactive UI.
Most UIs are handled through Fusion and a custom Statemanager, which makes everything feel dynamic and snappy.

Iâ€™ve added more README files inside the src folder, so you can see exactly what's happening in the right context.
I hope you donâ€™t get lost â€” and I hope itâ€™s not too bad ðŸ˜…
